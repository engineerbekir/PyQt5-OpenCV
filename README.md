In this project;

I design a very basic GUI that use the Model-View-Controller for the image processing application.This project also contains instructions to make a basic image editing application in Python.

                            The first imge is original image of Togg car.

                             And now second image is blur image of Togg car.

                               And the last one is brightness image of Togg car.       

As you can see, The user can change brightness and blur of the image frames and save images.
